/// \mainpage Virtual Trackball Orbiting via the Exponential Map
///
/// This is an alternative trackball technique using exponential map and
/// parallel transport to preserve distances and angles for inducing coherent
/// and intuitive trackball rotations. For instance, displacements on straight
/// radial lines through the screen's center are carried to arcs of the same
/// length on great circles of the trackball. This is in contrast to
/// state-of-the-art techniques using orthogonal projection which distorts
/// radial distances further away from the screen's center. This implementation
/// strictly follows the recipe given in the paper of Stantchev, G.. “Virtual
/// Trackball Modeling and the Exponential Map.” . [S2CID][] [44199608][].

/// # Example
///
/// A trackball camera mode implementation can be as easy as this by delegating
/// events of your 3D graphics library of choice to the \ref trackball_orbit
/// operation implementation along with other implementations for common
/// trackball camera mode operations like slide, scale, and focus.

/// Computes rotation between previous and current cursor/finger position.

/// Normalization of previous position is cached and has to be discarded on

/// between origin and maximum position as screen's width and height.

/// Screen space with origin in top left corner:
///
///   * x-axis from left to right,
///   * y-axis from top to bottom.

/// Camera space with origin at its target, the trackball's center:
///
///   * x-axis from left to right,
///   * y-axis from bottom to top,
///   * z-axis from far to near.
///
/// Parameter types are either `float*`, `double*` or `long double*` and point
/// to arrays or structures comprising vector components in the order they are
/// mentioned in their parameter name with the type of the output parameter \p
/// xyzw controlling the generic selection of the implementation's scalar type.
